# One-piece-pirate-information


This is was a fun smalll project I did a while back in my first cs class that lets you save various information on pirates in the one piece universe. 


This project is a simple C++ CRUD application that lets users manage a database of One Piece pirates. With it, users can:

  . Add a new pirate by entering their name, bounty, and bio.
  . Search for a specific pirate by name in the database.
  . Update details for an existing pirate, such as their name, bounty, or bio.
  . Remove a pirate from the database by resetting their information.
  . Save the database to a file so it can be retrieved later.
  . It's a straightforward way to interact with data using basic C++ features like   structs, file handling, and user input.



All you have to do is download the folder together and set it up in your ide to use. All information is saved to the bount.txt document
